# Namaste Foundation

Namaste Foundation is the site belonging to the Foundation of the same name. It hopes to be a modern way to attract a community of like minded individuals to learn more about the Foundation principles and sign up to volunteer. It is based in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted people who are yoga and meditation teachers, but also people who wants to learn and make the world a better place.
Namaste Foundation website will be useful for volunteers to see themselves represented in the gallery page, and for new volunteers to join the Foundation.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Volunteer page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  - I wanted to highlight the page the user is in, and for it to light up when selecting as well, to make it more user friendly.

- __The landing page image and mission section__

  - The landing includes an image of a Budha in a meditation position during a sunset and a section right next to it, where we read the Namaste's Foundation Mission. 
  - This section introduces the user to the Namaste Foundation with a peaceful image and colour pallete that resembles the one found at the studio.
  - The user will learn what the word Namaste means, get a calm sensation after seeing the Budha meditating and learn about the core values of the foundation.
  - It was important to highlight in the first page that this is an NGO and all the help comes from volunteers.
  - It was important that all would be in one block to show how they complement each other.

  - The gallery will provide the user with images of the volunteers doing and giving yoga and meditation classes.
  - This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to see how the studio looks like, the type of classes are provided and it also helps to give a face to the volunteers and their importance.
  - The gallery is divided in columns that will change size depending on the device used to view the page.
  - It provides a more real view to what the Foundation is about.

- __The Become a volunteer form__

  - This form will allow the user to become a volunteer and start their mindfullness journey. The user will be able to specify if they would like to take part in yoga, meditation or both. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.
  - The icon used beside "Become a volunteer" are praying hands, to continue with the same theme through all the website, the same as the same colour pallete used in the previous pages.

- __The Location and Contact section__

  - On the left of the page we will see the location of the Foundation with a map from Google maps. This allows the user to find it more easily. 
  - On the right of the page we can see the contact details such as address, email and phone number.
  - When the screen is viewed on mobile, the map will display on top of the contact section, to provide a clearer view.

### Features Left to Implement

- Library section where spiritual books can be bought online to support the foundation.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://github.com/JayKearney/namaste-foundation/blob/main/assets/images/read.me/html-validator.png)

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://github.com/JayKearney/namaste-foundation/blob/main/assets/images/read.me/css-validator.png)

### Fixed Bugs

- Unable to place the Budha image right next to our Mission section. Fixed it by checking CSS Tricks website and learned about flex box.

### Unfixed Bugs

- When on Ipad view, the Budha image looses resolution.
- When on mobile view, the contact paragraph remains too much to the right.
- Tried different media queries to fix it like I did with the iframe, but due to how they are setup originally, unable to do it without changing their root code.


## Deployment

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section heading. Select it and that will open a new page.
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the main Branch
  - Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Learnings

I definitely learned a lot from this first Project on what not to do.

I started to code before making a plan of what I wanted to achieve and so I spent more time having to fix errors that happened just because I didn't have a clear idea of the final result.

I learned to plan for mobile first when starting the project. At least the design. I found it very difficult to do the media queries without actually thinking about different responsive sizes before.

I learned that in future projects I will meet with my mentor before starting the project, so he can guide me from the start.

Overall it was a great learning experience and we always learn more from our own mistakes and I definitely did for these ones.
